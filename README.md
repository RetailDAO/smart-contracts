# Smart Contracts
This repository contains all smart contracts for RetailDAO, including the $RETAIL token, DAOs, and multisigs, hosted on the Base Network.

## Structure
- **retail-token**: Contracts and ABIs for the $RETAIL governance token.
- **original-dao**: Contracts for the Original Mint Authorized DAO (to be bricked).
- **governance-dao**: Contracts for the Current Governance DAO.
- **multisig-binding**: 6/10 multisig for binding/impactful proposals.
- **multisig-liquidity**: 4/8 multisig for liquidity management.
- **snapshots**: Documentation for Snapshot off-chain proposals.
- **docs**: Contract addresses, BaseScan links, and verification instructions.

## Transparency
- All contracts are publicly verifiable on [BaseScan](https://basescan.org/).
- The Original DAO's minting permissions will be revoked to cap $RETAIL supply at 1 billion tokens.
- Governance uses a hybrid model with on-chain (DAO, multisigs) and off-chain (Snapshot, Discord polls) mechanisms.
